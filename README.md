## My process

I started by adding all the necessary html elements in. Then from the top to bottom of
the component I began styling the html elements with css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learnt more about css flexbox through immense trial and error.
I also learnt more about the hover pseuodoclass for my anchor tags and nft image.
I briefly learnt about css box shadows.

### Continued development

I want to begin working on a responsive personal site that I develop solely in html/css/Javascript
where I document my learning process
